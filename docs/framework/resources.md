# Resources Reference

## Introduction

The *resources* subsystem supports loading Javascript code, CSS code, or image data. Most resources are static files bundled with CiviCRM. However, resources can also be external scripts, inline code-fragments, or dynamically-generated files. As of CiviCRM 4.2, the class `CRM_Core_Resources` manages these resources. This API works for both CiviCRM core and extensions.

!!! note "Resources and Regions"
    The HTML output for any CiviCRM page is divided into regions, such as the `html-header` or `page-footer`. When you add a resource, it must be added to some region. See also: [Region Reference](region.md)

    Most regions have a fairly consistent operation. However, the HTML `<head>` may have special constraints or interactions with the CMS environment. This is discussed in greater depth in [HTML Header Region](region.md#header).

!!! note "Resources and Extensions"
    The following examples assume that you wish to use resources provided by the extension `com.example.foo`. To use resources from your own extension, substitute appropriately. To use files provided by CiviCRM core, use the placeholder `civicrm`.

!!! note "Resources and CMS Plugins"
    If you are working outside CiviCRM Core or native extensions, you can still use `CRM_Core_Resources`, but you will need to ensure that CiviCRM is bootsrapped. See also: [Bootstraping guide](bootstrap.md).

## Javascript

The following examples load Javascript into the page footer. This is the default region, and is a good place to put scripts that are not needed on every page of the website. Note: if you're adding a jQuery Plugin or similar, you will need to add that to the HTML `<head>` region.

Language | Example | Example code |
--- | --- | --- |
PHP | Add a Javascript file provided by an extension | `Civi::resources()->addScriptFile('com.example.foo', 'bar.js');` |
PHP | Add an external Javascript file | `Civi::resources()->addScriptUrl('http://www.example.com/bar.js');` |
PHP | Add raw Javascript code | `Civi::resources()->addScript('alert("hello");');` |
Smarty | Add a Javascript file provided by an extension | `{crmScript ext=com.example.foo file=bar.js}` |
Smarty | Add an external Javascript file | `{crmScript url="http://www.example.com/bar.js"}` |

### Javascript Variables

If you need to export runtime data for use with JavaScript, then you can register `vars` with the resource manager. The data will be serialized (with JSON) and made available as part of JavaScript's `CRM` object. Example:

```php
// On the server:
Civi::resources()->addVars('myNamespace', array('foo' => 'bar'));
```

```javascript
// In your js file:
CRM.alert(CRM.vars.myNamespace.foo); // Alerts "bar"
```

More infomation can be found in the [Javascript reference](../standards/javascript.md).

## CSS StyleSheets

Language | Example | Example code |
--- | --- | --- |
PHP | Add a CSS file provided by an extension | `Civi::resources()->addStyleFile('com.example.foo', 'bar.css');` |
PHP | Add an external CSS file | `Civi::resources()->addStyleUrl('http://www.example.com/bar.css');` |
PHP | Add raw CSS code | `Civi::resources()->addStyle('body { background: black; }');` |
Smarty | Add a CSS file provided by an extension | `{crmStyle ext=com.example.foo file=bar.css}` |
Smarty | Add an external CSS file | `{crmStyle url="http://www.example.com/bar.css"}` |

## Other Resource URLs

If you need to reference any other kind of resource (such as image or sound file), then use these examples to construct a resource URL:

| Language | Example | Example Code |
--- | --- | --- |
PHP | Get an image URL | `Civi::resources()->getUrl('com.example.foo', 'bar.png');` |
PHP | Get an extension's base URL | `Civi::resources()->getUrl('com.example.bar');` |
Smarty | Get an image URL | `{crmResURL ext=com.example.foo file=bar.png}` |
Smarty | Get an extension's base URL | `{crmResURL ext=com.example.foo }` |

!!! note "Note about `{crmResURL}` vs `{crmURL}`"
    `{crmResURL}` sounds similar to another Smarty tag, `{crmURL}`, but they are functionally distinct: `{crmURL}` constructs the URL of a dynamic web page, adjusting the path and query parameters of the URL based on the CMS. By contrast, `{crmResURL}` constructs the URL of a static resource file; because the file is static, one may link directly without using the CMS or manipulating query parameters.

## Advanced Options

When including Javascript files or CSS files in the HTML `<head>`, the exact placement of the `<script>` and `<style>` tags can be significant. There are two options for manipulating placement:

* Region: By default, codes are injected inside the HTML `<head>`. To delay execution of code until later in the transfer of a page, you may want to place the tag further down in the `<body>`. You can specify the region as one of:
    * "page-header"
    * "page-body"
    * "page-footer" (default)
    * "html-header" (should always be used for jQuery plugins that refer to jQuery as `jQuery` and not `cj`)
* Weight: Within a given region, tags are sorted by a numerical weight (ascending order). The default weight is '0'

For PHP APIs (`addScriptFile()`, `addScriptUrl()`, etc), the `$weight` and `$region` are optional function arguments which you may tack onto the end of each function call:

```php
Civi::resources()->addScriptFile('com.example.foo', 'jquery.bar.js', 10, 'html-header');
Civi::resources()->addScriptUrl('http://example.com/bar.css', 10, 'page-header');
```

For Smarty APIs (`{crmScript}` and `{crmStyle}`), the optional weight and region parameters may also be added:

```
{crmScript ext=com.example.foo file=bar.js weight=10 region=page-footer}
{crmStyle url="http://example.com/bar.css" weight=10 region=page-footer}
```

If extensions want to modify what core styles and scripts are loaded you can use the hook [`hook_civicrm_coreResourceList`](../hooks/hook_civicrm_coreResourceList.md) to modify which styles or scripts are loaded. The hook would also allow you to add an array of javascript settings into the CRM javascript object.
